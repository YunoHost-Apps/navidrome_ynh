In particular, Yunohost may use this is in the future to easily track CVE (=security reports) related to apps. The CPE may be obtained by searching here: https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe/search. For example, for Nextcloud, the CPE is 'cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud' (no need to include the version number)

YunoHost may later advertise it in the webadmin.
